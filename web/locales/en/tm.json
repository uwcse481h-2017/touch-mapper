If important features are missing, you may freely add them to OpenStreetMap using the Edit button at the top of the OpenStreetMap page. Unfortunately, commercial map data sources like Google Maps can't be used, because they don't allow required type of access to their data in order to generate tactile maps.",

In this mode, there will be no borders around the edges of the map. Also, there appears arrow buttons for adjusting the selected area by 100% (that is, map's diameter) in each direction, which makes it easy to select adjacent areas for the maps.",

Two top layers and one horizontal shell are enough. You may want to print the top layer quite slowly to get smooth surfaces. If you use Simplify3D slicer, you will need to invoke \"Separate Connected Surfaces\" to get a correct print. Printing time for a 17 cm map with the base printed in two layers is around 3–4 hours.",
    "about_touch_mapper": "About Tactile MapTile",

Inspired by the ideas introduced by a Design student Jess Hamilton at the university and the original Touch Mapper created by Samuli Kärkkäinen, we've created Tactile MapTile to try to improve the accessibility of the build environment by creating 3D printable tactile maps. We created Tactile MapTile after learning more about the challenges faced by people who are blind or partially sighted when travelling independently, and realized how 3D printing combind with freely available map data can help. We have integrated Tactile MapTile with __startTag__Playful Pixels'__endTag__ 3D printing service to make buying the maps as easy and affordable as possible.",
